About Me!  

I'm Kathryn.  I'm a complete nube to the programming world.  I totally just Jackie Chan-ed my way to make this page, but I'm glad it's up and running (a la Forrest Gump)!

I'm an industrial engineer with lots of data to analyze and I'm hoping that adding programming to my toolbox will help me out at work... or maybe change my career path.  

Anyway, food (usually sugar) and dance (more watching than doing) keep me sane in the meantime.
